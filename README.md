# pyClient

This is a Python-based chat client to use with the ChatServer server.

Being Python-based, it is cross-platform. If using on Windows, it is recommended to run inside PowerShell, as opposed to cmd (unexpected behavior at times) or the Git Bash (chomps newlines occasionally).

This client is intended to eventually have a GUI for ease of access.
